# Parkinsons-Disease-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
## Problem Statement
Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people
around the globe. Detecting Parskinson’s disease at an earlier stage could help to better diagnose the disease.

This disease largely limits the patient’s movement and speech abilities. The patient develops a tendency to fall frequently hence, ending up hurt with various injuries. Thus, it is very important to monitor and notify either the patients or their caregivers about the severity of the disease.

Popular machine learning algorithms are applied to the given dataset so as to classify people whether they are affected or not.

## Dataset
Our dataset is from Kaggle listed under the name “Parkinson’s Disease Classification” and it initially included about 3 million data points. It contained 27 features and 1 label which can be examined. Two data points from the unprocessed dataset We processed some of the existing features, created new features that we thought could be useful for prediction, and discarded some features using the library Pandas.

## Dataset Information
The PD database consists of training and test files. The training data belongs to 20 PWP (6 female, 14 male) and 20 healthy individuals (10 female, 10 male) who appealed at the Department of Neurology in Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. From all subjects, multiple types of sound recordings (26 voice samples including sustained vowels, numbers, words, and short sentences) are taken. A group of 26 linear and time frequency-based features are extracted from each voice sample. UPDRS (Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale) score of each patient which is determined by an expert physician is also available in this dataset.

During the collection of this dataset, 28 PD patients are asked to say only the sustained vowels 'a' and 'o' three times respectively which makes a total of 168 recordings. The same 26 features are extracted from voice samples of this dataset. This dataset can be used as an independent test set to validate the results obtained on the training set.

## Steps used for solving the problem
1. Read the Input dataset.
2. Perform all necessary Data Normalization, Standardization processing to prepare the transformed format of the given input dataset.
3.  Impute Missing values
4.  Perform Exploratory Data Analysis/Visualization and bring insights into the predictor variables.
5.  Apply Logistic Regression Classification, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, and Decision tree classifier by splitting data into train and test.
6.  Measure the Performance of the model using K-fold Cross Validation and obtain the values of Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.
7.   Apply statistical tests to explain the goodness of fit.

## Visualisation

## Applying Classification algorithms

## 1. Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to assign observations to a discrete set of classes. Logistic regression transforms its output using the logistic sigmoid function to return a probability value.

The figure above shows the confusion matrix for the logistic regression classifier application on the Speech recording dataset for Parkinson's disease.

## 2. Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It's a family of algorithms 
where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified are independent of each other.

The figure above shows the confusion matrix for the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier application on the Speech recording dataset for Parkinson's disease.


## 3. Decision Tree Classifier
The decision criteria are different for classification and regression trees. Decision trees use multiple algorithms to decide to split a node into two or more sub-nodes. ... The decision tree splits the nodes on all available variables and then selects the split which results in the most homogeneous sub-nodes.

## Summary
### Problem Statement: 
To detect if a person has Parkinson’s disease or not use multiple types of sound recordings.
All the models are compared using a table where the accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score have been 
mentioned. Although Gaussian Naive Bayes has the highest accuracy value, the T-test will confirm which model is the best fit for the given dataset.
### Dataset: 
The dataset consists of: Train:(1040,29) 	Test:(168,28)
### Steps used to solve the problem:
Based on the least RMSE value of the particular algorithm, the data used was normalized or standardized, or raw.
### Results: 
#### T-test: 
The T-Test is performed between all the models taken two at a time and the only set where the null hypothesis was accepted is when the test was performed between Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
### Conclusion: 
Hence, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes are our best-fit models.
