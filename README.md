# Parkinsons-Disease-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
## Problem Statement
Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people
around the globe. Detecting Parskinson’s disease at an earlier stage could help to better diagnose the disease.

This disease largely limits the patient’s movement and speech abilities. The patient develops a tendency to fall frequently hence, ending up hurt with various injuries. Thus, it is very important to monitor and notify either the patients or their caregivers about the severity of the disease.

Popular machine learning algorithms are applied to the given dataset so as to classify people whether they are affected or not.

## Dataset
Our dataset is from Kaggle listed under the name “Parkinson’s Disease Classification” and it initially included about 3 million data points. It contained 27 features and 1 label which can be examined. Two data points from the unprocessed dataset We processed some of the existing features, created new features that we thought could be useful for prediction, and discarded some features using the library Pandas.
