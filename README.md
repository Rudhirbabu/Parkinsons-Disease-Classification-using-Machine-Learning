## Problem Statement
Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people
around the globe. Detecting Parskinson’s disease at an earlier stage could help to better diagnose the disease.

This disease largely limits the patient’s movement and speech abilities. The patient develops a tendency to fall frequently hence, ending up hurt with various injuries. Thus, it is very important to monitor and notify either the patients or their caregivers about the severity of the disease.

Popular machine learning algorithms are applied to the given dataset so as to classify people whether they are affected or not.
